      <h3 id="ghost">Ghost Sharks</h3>
      <p>
        These are cartilaginous fish that are very closely related to sharks,
        but they diverged about four hundred million years ago. We think there
        are around fifty species, devided into three groups; the long nose, the
        short nose, and the plough nose. And while most are deep sea creatures,
        a few live or can venture into shallower waters.<br> 
        Ghost sharks are also
        known as chimeras, a name they get because the Greek word chimera refers
        to a monster who's body consists of parts of different animals joined
        together. And ghost sharks have a very strange body. Instead of having
        rows of sharp teeth like true sharks, ghost sharks have three pairs of
        tooth plates. And these never fall out, instead they keep growing
        throughout their lives.<br>And unlike true sharks, ghost sharks don't have
        scales on the majority of their body. Only males have some on their
        reproductive organs. And in addition to having the same reproductive
        organs as true sharks, male ghost sharks have a third retractable
        reproductive organ on their head. And while true sharks have five gill
        slits, or sometimes more, ghost sharks only have four gills. And only
        one of these has an external opening. The others have a fleshy covering
        over them.<br>Another difference is that while true sharks use their tail
        to propel them, the ghost sharks simply glides along using its pectoral
        fins. Ghost sharks are different from all other fish, in that they're
        the only group of fish to have true nostrils. And finally, they have a
        venomous spine in front of their dorsal fin. If you thought they were
        weird looking as adults, they look even weirder as babies.

      <h3 id="bigfin">Bigfin Squid</h3>
      <p>
        Until 2001 we had only ever seen juveniles, and they were named after
        their heart shaped fin which are very prominent as juveniles. So in 2001
        we saw the adult bigfin squid which have these long appendages, but it
        wasn't until 2006 we saw an in between developmental stage that allowed
        us to link the two together.<br>Most of its length comes from its long
        appendages. They can be 20 times the length of its body. The largest
        bigfin squid was 6.4 meters long, and it's appendages were 6.1 meters
        long. We don't really know how these appendages are used. Maybe they
        drag them along the sea floor, or maybe just suspend them in the water.
        We just don't know that much about the bigfin squids. We think there are
        about three to five species, but we rarely encounter them considering
        they're the deepest species of squid, having been found at a depth of
        6200 meters.

      <h3 id="vampire">Vampire Squid</h3>
      <p>
        Despite its name, this guy is closer to being an octopus than a squid,
        but it's actually in a different order than them both. It's the only
        species not extinct in this order. Also despite its name, its not a
        blood sucker.<br>In fact, it's one of the only cephalopods that is not a
        predator, instead feeding on bits of floating matter that it collects
        with its long filaments. So instead of its name being related to its
        feeding habits, it's because of the fact that when it's startled, it
        inverts its webbed arms creating a cloak that covers its mantle. As well
        as its striking cloak, it also has striking eyes, in fact proportional
        to its size, it has the biggest eyes of any living animal.

      <h3 id="octo">Flapjack Octopus</h3>
      <p>
        Their common name comes from their ability to flatten themselves like a
        pancake or a flapjack, which they do to appear less threatening to prey.
        Not only is their common name cute, but so is their scientific name,
        "Adorabilis".<br>We used to think that the vampire squid and flapjack
        octopus were closely related because of their webbing between their
        arms, but the flapjack octopus is an actual octopus. It's a species in
        the umbrella octopus group, named for the web between their arms, which
        they can use to help them move. This group is also known as the Dumbo
        octopus group because of the fins on their head which they can also use
        to help them move, which most other octopuses don't have. Umbrella or
        Dumbo octopuses are the deepest living group of octopuses.<br>They're also
        unique because they lack an ink sac. And the reason why the flapjack
        octopus in particular is unique, is that of all cephalopods its the most
        compressed in the anterior posterior axis. Most octopuses are 30-90 cm,
        the flapjack is only 18 cm.

        <h3 id="cute">Cute Sharks</h3>
        <p>
          Not all sharks are big and with teeth that can harm you. In fact, as
          much as 97% of shark species are completely harmless to humans due to
          their small size or due to their tooth shape.<br>Some examples of species
          that would be harmless to humans due to their small size include the
          smallest shark, the dwarf lantern shark. It has a maximum length of 20
          cm, though there was once one recorded to be 21.2 cm.<br>The other
          lantern sharks are also pretty small, with the largest being only 1
          meter. The lantern sharks are in the dogfish shark order. Another
          group of the dogfish sharks are the rough sharks, who all range in the
          49-150cm. Another order of sharks who are pretty small, is the cat
          sharks with 160 species all being under 1 meter, most under 80 cm.
          Some particularly cute species of cat shark are the shy sharks, who's
          name comes from their defensive behavior where it curls into a circle
          and covers its eyes with its tail. And lastly, the bullhead sharks is
          another order that are pretty small, with the species all being about
          1 meter.

        <h3 id="sunfish">Ocean Sunfish</h3>
        <p>
          This fish gets a bad rep. They've geen called things like failure of evolution, but I don't think that's fair at all. Here's why I think they're actually pretty cool.<br/>
To start with, they're actually pretty chill. They spend about half of their day just sunbathing at the surface of the water. They do this in order to warm up after diving up to 800 meters to hunt for their favorite food; the jellyfish. And guess what they then use to eat these jellyfish. A beak! Ocean sunfishes teeth are actually fused together to form a beak like structure, so they're unable to ever close their mouths.<br/>
And instead of having scales like other fish, they have a thick rubbery skin that is covered in mucus. This skin gets really infested with parasites. Forty different types of parasites have been recorded on them. In fact, even their parasites have parasites. They get rid of some of their parasites by letting small fish and birds like seagulls pick at them. Their other strategy is to fly 3 meters into the air to try to shake the parasites upon landing.<br/>
As you might have noticed, they have a pretty unique bodyshape. They're flattened sideways and they don't have a tail. They are born with a backfin, but it simply never grows. So at the back of them, they have a clavus, which is a sort of pseudo tail formed by portions of the dorsal fin at the top and portions of the anal fin on the underbelly. This clavus functions as a rudder, enabling them to steer, and they flap their dorsal and anal fin to propel themselves. We used to think instead of swimming, they just drifted with the current, and so they were considered to be a plankton. But we now know that they can move against currents and swim at speeds similar to other large fish. Their weird shape doesn't hinder them.<br/>
Ocean sunfish are the heaviest species of bony fish. Sharks can be heavier, but those are cartilaginous fish. They weigh about 2000kg, which is the same weight as an adult rhino. They can reach about 4,3 meters vertically and 3 meters horizontally. Thought they end up as these big things, they start off as larvae that are only 2,5mm long. So by adulthood they can grow to about 60 million times their birth size. These larvae kind of looks like mini puffer fish, and ocean sunfish are very closely related to puffer fish. The produce 300 million eggs at a time, the most of any known vertebrae.<br/>
During the 16- and 1700's Japanese shotguns accepted Ocean sunfish as payment for taxes.
